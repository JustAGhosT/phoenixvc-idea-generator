# Data Visualization Core Components

The core directory contains the foundational building blocks for all data visualization components in the library. These components are designed to be highly reusable, composable, and accessible.

## Component Categories

### Shapes

Basic SVG shape components that form the visual elements of charts:

- **Bar**: Renders a single rectangular bar with customizable properties
- **GroupedBar**: Renders multiple bars side by side for grouped bar charts
- **StackedBar**: Renders stacked bar segments for stacked bar charts

### Axes

Components for rendering chart axes and grid lines:

- **Axis**: Base component for both X and Y axes
- **XAxis/YAxis**: Specialized components for horizontal and vertical axes
- **GridLines**: Renders background grid lines for better readability
- **AxisLine/AxisTick/AxisTitle**: Individual parts of an axis

### Canvas

Container components that provide the base structure for charts:

- **ChartCanvas**: SVG container with proper sizing, margins, and responsive behavior

### Markers

Components for highlighting specific data points or values:

- **DataPointIndicator**: Highlights specific data points with various shapes
- **AxisMarker**: Highlights specific points on an axis with reference lines

### Legend

Components for displaying chart legends:

- **Legend**: Container for legend items with various layout options
- **LegendItem**: Individual legend entries with interactive capabilities

### Animations

CSS animations and transitions for chart elements:

- Various animation modules for different chart types

## Design Principles

1. **Composition over inheritance**: Components are designed to be composed together
2. **Single responsibility**: Each component has a focused purpose
3. **Accessibility first**: Components are built with accessibility in mind
4. **Responsive by default**: Components adapt to container size
5. **Consistent API**: Components follow consistent patterns for props and callbacks

## Usage Guidelines

- Use the core components to build higher-level chart components
- Maintain separation of concerns between data processing and visualization
- Follow the established patterns for props, callbacks, and styling
- Ensure all interactive elements are keyboard accessible
- Use animations thoughtfully to enhance user experience

## Future Considerations

### Short-term Improvements

1. **Performance Optimization**:
   - Implement memoization for expensive calculations
   - Add virtualization for large datasets
   - Optimize SVG rendering with clipping and grouping

2. **Enhanced Accessibility**:
   - Add ARIA live regions for dynamic updates
   - Implement keyboard navigation between data points
   - Add screen reader announcements for data changes

3. **Animation Enhancements**:
   - Add animation orchestration for complex sequences
   - Implement enter/update/exit animations for data changes
   - Support animation pausing and resuming

4. **Interaction Improvements**:
   - Add touch-specific interactions for mobile
   - Implement gesture support (pinch to zoom, etc.)
   - Add brushing and selection capabilities

### Medium-term Roadmap

1. **Additional Chart Types**:
   - Area charts and stacked area charts
   - Scatter plots and bubble charts
   - Candlestick and OHLC charts
   - Radar and polar charts

2. **Advanced Features**:
   - Zooming and panning capabilities
   - Annotations and reference lines
   - Crosshair and tooltip synchronization
   - Multiple axes support

3. **Data Processing**:
   - Built-in data transformation utilities
   - Time series specific functionality
   - Statistical calculations (moving averages, etc.)
   - Outlier detection and highlighting

4. **Theming System**:
   - Comprehensive theme support
   - Dark mode and high contrast modes
   - Color palette generation for data series
   - Theme switching with animations

### Long-term Vision

1. **Integration with Data Sources**:
   - Real-time data streaming support
   - Data fetching and caching utilities
   - Integration with popular data libraries

2. **Advanced Visualizations**:
   - 3D visualizations with WebGL
   - Geographic mapping capabilities
   - Network and graph visualizations
   - Custom visualization compiler

3. **Tooling and Developer Experience**:
   - Visual editor for chart configuration
   - Performance profiling tools
   - Accessibility audit tools
   - Animation debugging tools

4. **Enterprise Features**:
   - Export to various formats (PNG, SVG, PDF)
   - Print optimization
   - Server-side rendering support
   - Internationalization and localization

## Contributing

When adding new core components or enhancing existing ones:

1. Follow the established file and directory structure
2. Maintain consistent naming conventions
3. Write comprehensive tests and stories
4. Document props and usage examples
5. Consider accessibility implications
6. Optimize for performance where appropriate
