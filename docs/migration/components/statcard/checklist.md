# StatCard Component Migration Checklist

## Phase A: Identification & Design

### 1. Identification Phase

- [ ] Identify all instances of the component
  - [ ] List all files where StatCard or similar components are used
  - [ ] Identify any related components (e.g., MetricDisplay, KPI)
- [ ] Current props interface
  ```typescript
  // Document current StatCard interfaces
  ```
- [ ] Variations in usage
  - [ ] Different metric types (numbers, percentages, currency)
  - [ ] Trend indicators (up/down arrows)
  - [ ] Time period selectors
- [ ] Current styling approach
  - [ ] Document current styling methods
  - [ ] Note any theming capabilities
- [ ] State management
  - [ ] Document loading states
  - [ ] Document error states
  - [ ] Document any interactive features

### 2. Design Phase

- [ ] Component classification (likely Molecule)
- [ ] Standardized interface
  ```typescript
  // Define new StatCard interface
  ```
- [ ] Directory structure
  - [ ] Define component location in new structure
- [ ] Design pattern
  - [ ] Consider composition pattern for flexibility
- [ ] CSS Module structure
  ```css
  /* Proposed StatCard CSS Module structure */
  ```
- [ ] Accessibility requirements
  - [ ] Define semantic structure for metrics
  - [ ] Ensure proper ARIA attributes for trend indicators
  - [ ] Consider screen reader announcements for data

### 3. Migration Strategy

- [ ] Migration approach
- [ ] Breaking changes and how to handle them
- [ ] Estimated effort
- [ ] Integration with design system

## Phase A Approval

- [ ] Design approved by: [Name] (Date: YYYY-MM-DD)
- [ ] Technical approach approved by: [Name] (Date: YYYY-MM-DD)
- [ ] Ready to proceed to Phase B

## Phase B: Implementation & Migration

### 1. Implementation Phase

- [ ] Create CSS/LESS module
  ```css
  /* Implement StatCard CSS Module */
  ```
- [ ] Implement component with variants
  ```tsx
  // Implement StatCard component
  ```
- [ ] Create adapter functions (if needed)
  ```tsx
  // Implement adapters for legacy stat card components
  ```
- [ ] Write unit tests
  ```tsx
  // Implement tests for StatCard
  ```
- [ ] Create Storybook stories
  ```tsx
  // Implement Storybook stories for StatCard
  ```

### 2. Migration Phase

- [ ] Move component to appropriate directory
- [ ] Update imports in all files
- [ ] Test component in all contexts
- [ ] Address any issues found during testing

### 3. Documentation Phase

- [ ] Add JSDoc comments
  ```tsx
  /**
   * StatCard component documentation
   */
  ```
- [ ] Document usage examples
- [ ] Document props
- [ ] Document accessibility considerations
- [ ] Document performance considerations

### 4. Cleanup Phase

- [ ] Verify all uses working correctly
- [ ] Remove old components
- [ ] Remove unused imports
- [ ] Clean up any temporary code

### 5. Review Phase

- [ ] Conduct code review
- [ ] Check for performance issues
- [ ] Verify accessibility compliance
- [ ] Ensure documentation is complete
- [ ] Final testing in all contexts

## Migration Completion

- [ ] Implementation completed by: [Name] (Date: YYYY-MM-DD)
- [ ] Code review completed by: [Name] (Date: YYYY-MM-DD)
- [ ] Migration approved by: [Name] (Date: YYYY-MM-DD)
