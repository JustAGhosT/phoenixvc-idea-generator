# Version Control Strategy for Component Migration

This document outlines the version control approach for the component migration project to ensure a smooth, trackable, and reversible process.

## Branching Strategy

### Branch Structure

We will use the following branch structure for the migration:

```
main
├── develop
│   ├── feature/migration/setup
│   ├── feature/migration/component-category-1
│   │   ├── feature/migration/component-1
│   │   ├── feature/migration/component-2
│   │   └── ...
│   ├── feature/migration/component-category-2
│   │   └── ...
│   └── ...
```

### Branch Naming Conventions

- **Main Feature Branch**: `feature/migration/setup` - For initial setup and infrastructure
- **Category Branches**: `feature/migration/[category-name]` - For category-level changes
- **Component Branches**: `feature/migration/[component-name]` - For individual component migrations

## Commit Guidelines

### Commit Message Format

```
[type]: [component] - [short description]

[detailed description (optional)]

[migration checklist items completed (optional)]
```

### Commit Types

- `setup`: Initial configuration and infrastructure
- `migrate`: Component migration implementation
- `refactor`: Code improvements without changing functionality
- `test`: Adding or updating tests
- `docs`: Documentation updates
- `fix`: Bug fixes during migration
- `chore`: Maintenance tasks

### Examples

```
migrate: StatCard - Implement new component with LESS module

- Created component directory structure
- Extracted styles to LESS module
- Implemented standardized interface
- Added unit tests
```

```
test: BarChart - Add comprehensive test suite

- Added rendering tests for all variants
- Added interaction tests
- Added accessibility tests
```

## Pull Request Process

### PR Template

Each PR should use a template that includes:

```markdown
## Component Migration: [Component Name]

### Changes
- [List of changes]

### Migration Checklist
- [x] Created component directory structure
- [x] Implemented standardized interface
- [x] Created LESS module
- [x] Added unit tests
- [x] Added Storybook stories
- [ ] Updated imports in consuming components
- [ ] Removed old implementation

### PR Size Guidelines

- Keep PRs focused on a single component or closely related components
- Aim for PRs that can be reviewed in under 30 minutes
- For complex components, consider breaking the migration into multiple PRs:
  1. Initial structure and interface
  2. Implementation and styling
  3. Tests and documentation
  4. Migration of usages

### Review Requirements

- At least one code review approval required
- All automated tests must pass
- Visual review of Storybook stories
- Accessibility compliance check

## Versioning Strategy

### Semantic Versioning

We will follow semantic versioning for the component library:

- **Major version**: Breaking changes to component APIs
- **Minor version**: New features or non-breaking enhancements
- **Patch version**: Bug fixes and minor updates

### Migration Versioning

During the migration, we will use the following approach:

1. Create a new package version for the migrated components
2. Use feature flags to toggle between old and new implementations
3. Incrementally adopt new components in the application

## Conflict Resolution

### Approach for Handling Conflicts

1. **Prevention**: Coordinate work to minimize conflicts between developers
2. **Regular Rebasing**: Rebase feature branches regularly from develop
3. **Pair Resolution**: Resolve complex conflicts in pairs
4. **Documentation**: Document any conflict resolution decisions

### Handling Concurrent Changes

If multiple developers need to work on related components:

1. Establish clear ownership boundaries
2. Create shared interfaces early
3. Use small, focused PRs to minimize integration challenges
4. Hold regular sync meetings to coordinate work

## Rollback Strategy

### Quick Rollback Process

In case of critical issues with a migrated component:

1. **Feature Flags**: Toggle back to the old implementation
2. **Revert Commit**: Create a revert commit for the problematic changes
3. **Hotfix**: Create a hotfix branch from main if needed

### Gradual Rollout

For high-risk components:

1. Implement both old and new versions
2. Use feature flags to control which users see the new version
3. Gradually increase the percentage of users seeing the new version
4. Monitor for issues before full rollout

## Tagging and Release Process

### Release Tagging

- Tag each significant milestone in the migration
- Use the format `migration-v1.0.0-[component-category]`
- Include release notes with each tag

### Release Notes Template

```markdown
# Component Migration Release: [Category]

## Components Migrated
- [Component 1]
- [Component 2]
- ...

## Breaking Changes
- [List of breaking changes]

## Migration Notes
- [Important notes for developers]

## Known Issues
- [List of known issues]
```

## Migration Tracking in Version Control

### Using GitHub Projects

Create a GitHub Project board with the following columns:

1. **To Migrate**: Components identified for migration
2. **In Progress**: Components currently being migrated
3. **In Review**: PRs under review
4. **Testing**: Components in testing phase
5. **Completed**: Fully migrated components

### Issue Linking

- Link each PR to the corresponding issue for the component migration
- Use GitHub's closing keywords to automatically close issues when PRs are merged

## Post-Migration Maintenance

### Cleanup Process

After all components are migrated:

1. Create a cleanup branch to remove deprecated components
2. Remove feature flags and conditional imports
3. Update documentation to reflect the new component structure
4. Archive migration-specific documentation

### Long-term Maintenance

- Establish guidelines for maintaining the new component structure
- Create processes for adding new components following the established patterns
- Set up monitoring for component usage and performance
