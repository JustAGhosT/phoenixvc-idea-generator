# Component Migration Roadmap - Updated

This roadmap outlines the phased approach for migrating components to the new structure with LESS modules and standardized interfaces. This is an updated version reflecting the current state and planned work.

## Current Status

We are in the planning phase of the component migration. We have identified the components to be migrated and created initial documentation for the migration approach. No components have been migrated yet.

âœ… **Planning Completed For**
- StatCard: Simple UI component with variants and trend indicators
- QuoteDisplay: Unified testimonial display with multiple variants
- BarChart: Flexible chart component with multiple series support
- Layout: Unified layout system with compound component pattern
- Sidebar: Navigation sidebar with collapsible sections
- Navigation: Main navigation component with responsive behavior
- ActivityList: Activity feed with customizable rendering
- ProjectsList: Projects display with filtering and sorting capabilities

All components have Phase A (identification and design) documentation. Phase B (implementation, migration, documentation, cleanup, and review) documentation has been created as a template but implementation has not begun.

## Key Observations and Planning Notes

Based on our analysis of the current codebase, we've made the following observations and plans:

1. **Component Patterns**: The compound component pattern will be effective for complex components like Layout, Sidebar, and Navigation. We'll use this pattern for these components.

2. **Documentation Approach**: The two-phase documentation approach (Phase A for identification/design and Phase B for implementation/migration) will ensure thorough planning before implementation.

3. **Adapter Pattern**: We'll use adapter functions to maintain backward compatibility, allowing incremental migration without breaking existing functionality.

4. **Directory Structure**: Components will be organized by function and type, with a consistent directory structure.

5. **LESS Integration**: We'll transition from the current styling approach to LESS modules for better maintainability and consistency.

## Next Steps

1. **Finalize Planning**: Complete the planning phase for all components.

2. **Set Implementation Timeline**: Establish concrete dates for the migration phases.

3. **Infrastructure Setup**: Set up the directory structure and LESS integration.

4. **Begin Simple Components**: Start with the migration of simple components like StatCard and QuoteDisplay.

5. **Regular Progress Reviews**: Implement regular check-ins to track progress and adjust the plan as needed.

## Risk Assessment

| Risk | Status | Mitigation |
|------|--------|------------|
| Breaking changes | Not yet assessed | Plan to use adapters and feature flags |
| Performance concerns | Not yet assessed | Will include performance testing in migration plan |
| Accessibility compliance | Not yet assessed | Will incorporate accessibility testing throughout |
| Timeline management | Not yet started | Will establish realistic timelines with buffer |
| Component consistency | Not yet assessed | Will implement code reviews and documentation standards |

## Success Metrics

We will track the following metrics throughout the migration:
- Number of components migrated
- Test coverage for migrated components
- Accessibility compliance
- Performance benchmarks
- Documentation completeness

This roadmap will be updated as the migration progresses to reflect the current status and any adjustments to the plan.
