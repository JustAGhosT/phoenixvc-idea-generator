# CSS Modules Migration Summary

This document summarizes the CSS Modules migration process, issues encountered, and lessons learned.

## Migration Overview

We've successfully migrated our component library to use CSS Modules with Tailwind CSS, following these key principles:

1. **Single CSS Module at Component Root**: Each component has one CSS Module file at its root level
2. **Relative Import Paths**: All components use relative paths to import CSS Modules
3. **Component-Prefixed Class Names**: All CSS classes follow a component-prefixed naming convention

## Issues Identified and Fixed

### 1. CSS Module Placement

We found several CSS Module files incorrectly placed in subdirectories:
- `src/components/data-visualization/bar-chart/parts/BarChart.module.css`
- `src/components/data-visualization/line-chart/parts/LineChartPartsAnimation.module.css`
- `src/components/data-visualization/pie-chart/parts/PieChartPartsAnimation.module.css`

These files were moved to their respective component root directories and renamed according to our conventions.

### 2. Import Paths

All components were already using relative paths for CSS Module imports, which is the correct approach.

### 3. Class Naming Conventions

We identified 417 CSS class names across 33 files that didn't follow our component-prefixed naming convention. For example:

- `.button` → `.buttonPrimary` (correct)
- `.primary` → `.buttonPrimary` (incorrect → corrected)

These class names were automatically renamed to follow the convention, and all references in component files were updated.

## Component Categories with Most Issues

1. **UI Components**: Button, Badge, Input, etc.
2. **Data Visualization Components**: Charts, graphs, etc.
3. **Layout Components**: Sidebar, etc.

## Tools Created for Migration

We developed several tools to assist with the migration:

1. `scripts/standardize-css-modules.js`: Moves CSS Module files to the correct locations
2. `scripts/merge-css-modules.js`: Merges CSS Module files when needed
3. `scripts/fix-css-module-imports.js`: Fixes absolute import paths
4. `scripts/check-css-class-naming.js`: Checks and fixes class naming conventions
5. `scripts/setup-css-module-linting.js`: Sets up linting rules

## Linting Rules Added

We've added the following linting rules to maintain consistency:

1. **ESLint**: Prevents absolute imports for CSS Modules
2. **Stylelint**: Enforces component-prefixed class naming conventions

## Best Practices Going Forward

1. **Always place CSS Module files at the component root level**
   ```
   button/
   ├── Button.tsx
   ├── Button.module.css  ← Here
   └── parts/
       └── ButtonIcon.tsx
   ```

2. **Always use relative imports for CSS Modules**
   ```tsx
   // In Button.tsx
   import styles from './Button.module.css';
   
   // In parts/ButtonIcon.tsx
   import styles from '../Button.module.css';
   ```

3. **Always prefix class names with the component name**
   ```css
   /* Button.module.css */
   .button { /* Base styles */ }
   .buttonPrimary { /* Primary variant */ }
   .buttonIcon { /* Icon styles */ }
   ```

4. **Use separate animation files for complex animations**
   ```
   button/
   ├── Button.tsx
   ├── Button.module.css
   ├── ButtonAnimations.module.css  ← Animation-specific styles
   └── parts/
       └── ButtonIcon.tsx
   ```

## Special Cases

The core visualization components have a more modular structure, where each core component can have its own CSS Module file. This is an exception to our standard structure due to the modular nature of these components.

## Ongoing Maintenance

To ensure continued compliance with these standards:

1. Run linting checks as part of your CI/CD pipeline
2. Conduct periodic audits of CSS Module usage
3. Include CSS Module standards in code reviews
4. Keep the documentation up to date as patterns evolve
