# Component Migration Tracking

This directory contains migration plans and tracking documents for components that are being consolidated and standardized as part of our component library modernization effort.

## Migration Overview

We're migrating components to a standardized structure with:
- Consistent directory organization
- Component-specific LESS modules
- Standardized TypeScript interfaces
- Comprehensive documentation
- Proper accessibility implementation
- Thorough testing

Each component has its own markdown file with:
- Current implementation details
- Migration plan with standardized interface
- Directory structure and LESS module design
- Implementation strategy and usage examples
- Accessibility and performance considerations
- Unit testing strategy
- Detailed migration checklist
- Timeline and resource estimates
- Risk assessment and mitigation strategies
- Success criteria

| [ProjectsList](./components/projects-list.md) | Not Started | Low | Medium | - |

## Migration Guidelines and Standards

Our migration follows these standardized guidelines:

- [Migration Checklist](./migration-checklist.md) - Step-by-step process for component migration
- [LESS Integration](./less-integration.md) - Adding component-specific LESS modules
- [Testing Strategy](./testing-strategy.md) - Approach for testing migrated components
- [Performance Considerations](./performance-considerations.md) - Ensuring optimal component performance
- [Accessibility Guidelines](./accessibility-guidelines.md) - Making components accessible to all users
- [Dependency Management](./dependency-management.md) - Managing component dependencies effectively
- [Version Control Strategy](./version-control-strategy.md) - Branching, commits, and release strategy
- [Migration Roadmap](./migration-roadmap.md) - Timeline and phased approach for the migration

## How to Use This Directory

1. Review the [migration roadmap](./migration-roadmap.md) to understand the overall plan
2. Check the [migration checklist](./migration-checklist.md) for the step-by-step process
3. Read the specific component migration plan before starting work
4. Follow the guidelines in the standards documents
5. Update the status in this README as you progress through the migration
6. Document any issues or considerations that arise during migration
7. Mark as complete when the component has been fully migrated and tested

## Migration Process

For each component, follow these general steps:

1. **Identify** - Find all instances and usages of the component
2. **Design** - Create a standardized interface and plan the implementation
3. **Implement** - Create the new unified component with its LESS module
4. **Test** - Follow the testing strategy to ensure quality
5. **Migrate** - Update imports and usages throughout the codebase
6. **Document** - Add proper documentation and examples
7. **Clean up** - Remove old implementations once migration is complete
8. **Review** - Conduct a final review and testing

## Directory Structure

The new component directory structure will be:

```

```

## Recommended Migration Order

Based on dependencies and complexity, we recommend migrating components in this order:

1. **StatCard** - Simple component with clear inconsistencies
2. **QuoteDisplay** - Self-contained with two distinct implementations
3. **BarChart** - Important for dashboard functionality
4. **Sidebar** - Critical for navigation but more complex
5. **Layout** - Builds on sidebar implementation
6. **Navigation** - Complements layout components
7. **ActivityList** - Feature-specific component
8. **ProjectsList** - Feature-specific component

## Quality Assurance

All migrated components must meet these quality standards:

1. **Accessibility** - Follow [Accessibility Guidelines](./accessibility-guidelines.md)
2. **Performance** - Adhere to [Performance Considerations](./performance-considerations.md)
3. **Testing** - Implement tests per the [Testing Strategy](./testing-strategy.md)
4. **Dependencies** - Follow [Dependency Management](./dependency-management.md) guidelines
5. **Version Control** - Use the [Version Control Strategy](./version-control-strategy.md)

## Challenges and Mitigation

| Challenge | Mitigation Strategy |
|-----------|---------------------|
| Breaking changes | Use feature flags for gradual rollout |
| Performance regressions | Implement performance testing and monitoring |
| Inconsistent styling | Enforce LESS module patterns and design system |
| Testing coverage | Establish minimum test coverage requirements |
| Documentation gaps | Create documentation templates and standards |

## Additional Components Identified

Based on the repository analysis, these additional components need migration in future phases:

- **Error Components** - `components/error/error-boundary.tsx`, `components/error/error-page.tsx`
- **Auth Components** - `components/auth/auth-guards.tsx`, `components/auth/sign-in-form.tsx`
- **Media Components** - `components/features/media/audio-recorder.tsx`, `components/features/media/file-uploader.tsx`
- **Analysis Components** - Various analysis components in `components/features/analysis/`

## Progress Tracking

We'll track migration progress in this README and in individual component files. Update the status column in the table above as components are migrated using these status values:

- **Not Started** - Migration not yet begun
- **In Progress** - Migration actively being worked on
- **In Review** - Migration complete and awaiting review
- **Completed** - Migration fully completed and old components removed
