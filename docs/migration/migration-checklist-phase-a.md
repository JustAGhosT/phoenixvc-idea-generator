# Component Migration Checklist - Phase A

This checklist covers the initial identification and design phases of component migration. Use this document to analyze existing components and plan their migration to the new architecture.

## Component Name: ________________

### 1. Identification Phase

- [ ] Identify all instances of the component in the codebase
  - [ ] Search for import statements
  - [ ] Search for component usage in JSX/TSX
  - [ ] Search for references in documentation or comments
- [ ] List all files where the component is used
- [ ] Document the current props interface and behavior
  ```typescript
  // Document current interface
  interface CurrentComponentProps {
    // List all props with their types
  }
  ```
- [ ] Identify any variations or inconsistencies in usage
- [ ] Analyze current styling approach and dependencies
- [ ] Identify current state management approach
- [ ] Document any performance or accessibility issues

### 2. Design Phase

- [ ] Determine component classification
  - [ ] Core Component (Atom)
  - [ ] Composite Component (Molecule)
  - [ ] Feature Component (Organism)
  - [ ] Layout Component
  - [ ] Page Component
- [ ] Design a standardized interface
  ```typescript
  // Define new interface
  export interface NewComponentProps {
    // List all props with their types and descriptions
  }
  ```
  - [ ] Define required and optional props
  - [ ] Set appropriate default values
  - [ ] Create TypeScript interfaces
  - [ ] Document prop types and descriptions
- [ ] Identify the appropriate directory for the component
  - Proposed path: `src/components/[category]/[ComponentName]/`
- [ ] Determine if component should use a design pattern:
  - [ ] Compound Component pattern
  - [ ] Render Props pattern
  - [ ] Custom Hook pattern
  - [ ] Composition pattern
- [ ] Create LESS module structure
  - [ ] Define component-specific variables
  - [ ] Plan responsive breakpoints
  - [ ] Define component variants
- [ ] Plan any necessary refactoring for better composition
- [ ] Consider accessibility requirements
  - [ ] Review [Accessibility Guidelines](../accessibility-guidelines.md)
  - [ ] Plan ARIA attributes and roles
  - [ ] Plan keyboard navigation
- [ ] Define responsive behavior requirements
- [ ] Plan state management approach
  - [ ] Local state
  - [ ] Context API
  - [ ] Custom hooks
  - [ ] External state management

### 3. Migration Strategy

- [ ] Determine migration approach:
  - [ ] Direct replacement
  - [ ] Parallel implementation with feature flag
  - [ ] Incremental adoption
- [ ] Identify potential breaking changes
- [ ] Plan backward compatibility strategy
- [ ] Estimate migration effort and timeline
- [ ] Identify dependencies that need to be updated
- [ ] Plan testing strategy for the migrated component
