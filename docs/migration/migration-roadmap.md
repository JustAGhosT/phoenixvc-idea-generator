## Dependencies and Critical Path

The migration follows these key dependencies:

1. **Foundation ‚Üí Core UI ‚Üí Feature Components ‚Üí Integration ‚Üí Cleanup**
2. **Directory structure must be set up before any component migration**
3. **Tailwind and CSS Modules must be configured before component styling**
4. **Core types must be defined before implementing components that use them**
5. **Layout components should be migrated before components that depend on them**

## Risk Assessment

| Risk | Probability | Impact | Mitigation |
|------|------------|--------|------------|
| Breaking changes disrupt application | Medium | High | Use feature flags, thorough testing |
| Performance regressions | Medium | Medium | Performance testing, monitoring |
| Inconsistent implementation | Medium | Medium | Code reviews, documentation |
| Timeline slippage | Medium | Medium | Buffer time, prioritize critical components |
| Accessibility issues | Low | High | Automated and manual a11y testing |
| CSS conflicts between Tailwind and existing styles | High | Medium | Proper scoping with CSS Modules, careful migration |

## Success Criteria

The migration will be considered successful when:

1. All components are migrated from LESS to CSS Modules with Tailwind
2. Each component has its own CSS Module
3. All components have standardized interfaces
4. All components pass accessibility tests
5. All components have documentation
6. No performance regressions
7. All tests pass
8. Old LESS files are removed
9. Application functions correctly with new components

## Monitoring and Reporting

Progress will be tracked through:

1. Weekly status updates
2. Component migration checklist completion
3. Test coverage reports
4. Performance metrics
5. Accessibility audit results

## Post-Migration Activities

After the migration is complete:

1. Document the new component library
2. Create a component showcase
3. Establish guidelines for new component development
4. Set up monitoring for component usage and performance
5. Plan for future enhancements
