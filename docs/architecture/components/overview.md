# Component Architecture Overview

## Introduction

Our component architecture follows a structured approach to ensure maintainability, reusability, and performance. This document provides an overview of our component system and the principles that guide its development.

## Component Hierarchy

We organize our components into the following categories:

1. **Core Components** - Fundamental building blocks (atoms)
2. **Composite Components** - Combinations of core components (molecules)
3. **Feature Components** - Business logic specific components (organisms)
4. **Layout Components** - Page structure components
5. **Page Components** - Full page implementations

## Atomic Design Principles

Our component architecture is inspired by Atomic Design principles:

- **Atoms**: Basic UI elements (Button, Input, etc.)
- **Molecules**: Simple component combinations (InputGroup, Card, etc.)
- **Organisms**: Complex UI sections (Header, Sidebar, etc.)
- **Templates**: Page layouts
- **Pages**: Specific instances of templates

## Component Library Goals

Our component library aims to:

1. **Maintain consistency** across the application
2. **Improve developer experience** through clear patterns and documentation
3. **Ensure accessibility** for all users
4. **Optimize performance** for a smooth user experience
5. **Support theming** including dark mode
6. **Scale efficiently** as the application grows

## Migration Status

We are currently migrating our component system from LESS to CSS Modules with Tailwind integration. This migration aims to:

1. Improve component isolation through CSS Modules
2. Standardize design tokens using Tailwind and CSS variables
3. Enhance maintainability through smaller, focused style files
4. Better support for dark mode and theming

See the [Migration Guide](./migration-guide.md) for details on our migration process and standards.
