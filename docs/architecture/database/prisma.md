# Prisma in Our Architecture

## Overview

Prisma is a next-generation ORM (Object-Relational Mapping) that consists of several tools to help developers build applications with databases. It provides a type-safe database client, schema migrations, and a visual database editor.

## Key Components

- **Prisma Client**: Auto-generated and type-safe query builder for Node.js & TypeScript
- **Prisma Migrate**: Declarative data modeling & migration system
- **Prisma Studio**: GUI to view and edit data in your database

## When to Use Prisma

### Ideal Use Cases

1. **Type Safety Requirements**
   - When you need complete type safety between your database schema and application code
   - For projects where catching errors at compile time is critical

2. **Complex Data Modeling**
   - When your application has complex relationships between models
   - For projects requiring sophisticated querying capabilities

3. **Schema Evolution**
   - When you need a robust migration system to evolve your database schema over time
   - For projects with changing data requirements

4. **Database Agnostic Development**
   - When you might need to switch database providers in the future
   - For projects that need to work with multiple database types

5. **Server-Side API Development**
   - For building REST or GraphQL APIs with Node.js/TypeScript
   - When you need strong guarantees about the shape of your data

## Integration with Supabase

In our architecture, we use Prisma as the primary ORM layer when:

- We need fine-grained control over database schema and migrations
- We require type-safe database access from our server-side code
- We're building complex queries that benefit from Prisma's query builder

Prisma connects to our Supabase PostgreSQL database, giving us the benefits of both technologies:
- Supabase provides the hosted PostgreSQL database, authentication, and other backend services
- Prisma provides the type-safe ORM layer for our application code

## Code Example

```typescript
// Example of Prisma schema
model User {
  id        Int      @id @default(autoincrement())
  email     String   @unique
  name      String?
  posts     Post[]
  profile   Profile?
  createdAt DateTime @default(now())
  updatedAt DateTime @updatedAt
}

model Post {
  id        Int      @id @default(autoincrement())
  title     String
  content   String?
  published Boolean  @default(false)
  author    User     @relation(fields: [authorId], references: [id])
  authorId  Int
  createdAt DateTime @default(now())
  updatedAt DateTime @updatedAt
}

// Example of Prisma client usage
async function main() {
  // Create a new user with a new post
  const user = await prisma.user.create({
    data: {
      email: 'alice@example.com',
      name: 'Alice',
      posts: {
        create: {
          title: 'Hello World',
          content: 'This is my first post!',
        },
      },
    },
    include: {
      posts: true,
    },
  })
  console.log(user)
}
```

## Advantages

- **Type Safety**: Catch errors at compile time rather than runtime
- **Productivity**: Auto-completion and intelligent suggestions in your IDE
- **Declarative Schema**: Define your database schema using Prisma Schema Language
- **Migration System**: Version control your database schema changes
- **Query Builder**: Intuitive API for complex queries
- **Performance**: Efficient query generation

## Limitations

- **Learning Curve**: New syntax and concepts to learn
- **Abstraction Layer**: Adds another layer between your code and the database
- **Limited Raw SQL**: Some complex operations may require raw SQL
- **Overhead**: May add some performance overhead for simple applications

## Best Practices

1. Keep your Prisma schema in sync with your database using migrations
2. Use transactions for operations that require multiple related changes
3. Take advantage of Prisma's relation queries to avoid N+1 query problems
4. Consider using Prisma's middleware for cross-cutting concerns like logging
5. Use Prisma Studio during development for visualizing and editing data
