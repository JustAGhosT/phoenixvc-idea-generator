# Supabase in Our Architecture

## Overview

Supabase is an open-source Firebase alternative that provides a suite of tools and services to help developers build applications. At its core, it's a PostgreSQL database with additional services built around it, including authentication, storage, and real-time subscriptions.

## Key Components

- **PostgreSQL Database**: Fully managed PostgreSQL database
- **Auth**: Built-in user management and authentication
- **Storage**: File storage and management
- **Edge Functions**: Serverless functions for backend logic
- **Realtime**: Live database changes via WebSockets

## When to Use Supabase

### Ideal Use Cases

1. **Authentication Requirements**
   - When you need a ready-made authentication system
   - For projects requiring social logins, magic links, or multi-factor authentication

2. **Real-time Data**
   - When your application needs live updates
   - For collaborative features or live dashboards

3. **File Storage**
   - When you need to store and serve user-generated content
   - For applications dealing with images, videos, or documents

4. **Rapid Development**
   - When you need to quickly prototype and launch features
   - For projects with tight deadlines

5. **Client-Side Heavy Applications**
   - For SPAs, mobile apps, or other client-heavy architectures
   - When you want to minimize backend development

## Integration with Prisma

In our architecture, we use Supabase as the underlying database and service provider, while using Prisma as our ORM layer. This combination gives us:

- Supabase for hosting PostgreSQL, authentication, storage, and other services
- Prisma for type-safe database access and schema management

This approach allows us to leverage:
- Supabase's managed infrastructure and built-in services
- Prisma's developer experience and type safety

## Code Example

```typescript
// Example of using Supabase client directly
import { createClient } from '@supabase/supabase-js'

const supabase = createClient(
  process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL,
  process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY
)

// Authentication
const { data, error } = await supabase.auth.signUp({
  email: 'example@email.com',
  password: 'example-password',
})

// Database query
const { data, error } = await supabase
  .from('posts')
  .select('*, author(*)')
  .eq('published', true)

// Real-time subscription
const channel = supabase
  .channel('schema-db-changes')
  .on(
    'postgres_changes',
    { event: 'INSERT', schema: 'public', table: 'posts' },
    (payload) => console.log('New post:', payload.new)
  )
  .subscribe()
```

## Advantages

- **All-in-One Solution**: Database, auth, storage, and more in one platform
- **PostgreSQL-Based**: Leverage the power and flexibility of PostgreSQL
- **Real-time Capabilities**: Built-in WebSocket connections for live data
- **Row-Level Security**: Define security policies directly in the database
- **Dashboard**: Visual interface for managing data and services
- **Edge Functions**: Serverless functions for backend logic
- **Open Source**: Core functionality is open source

## Limitations

- **Vendor Lock-in**: Some features are specific to Supabase
- **Learning Curve**: Understanding PostgreSQL and RLS policies
- **Limited Database Options**: PostgreSQL only
- **Pricing Model**: Costs can increase with heavy usage
- **Complex Migrations**: Some schema changes require careful planning

## Best Practices

1. Use Row Level Security (RLS) policies to secure your data
2. Leverage PostgreSQL functions for complex operations
3. Keep sensitive operations in edge functions rather than client code
4. Use Supabase's storage policies to control file access
5. Consider using Prisma alongside Supabase for type-safe database access

## When to Use Supabase vs. Direct Prisma Access

| Scenario | Recommended Approach |
|----------|---------------------|
| Client-side data access | Supabase Client |
| Authentication flows | Supabase Auth |
| File uploads/storage | Supabase Storage |
| Real-time features | Supabase Realtime |
| Server-side data access | Prisma Client |
| Complex data modeling | Prisma Schema |
| Database migrations | Prisma Migrate |
| Type-safe queries | Prisma Client |
