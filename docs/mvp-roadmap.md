# MVP Roadmap: DeFi Risk Intelligence Platform

## MVP Definition

The Minimum Viable Product (MVP) for the DeFi Risk Intelligence Platform will focus on providing essential risk analysis capabilities for DeFi projects with a streamlined user experience and core features.

## MVP Goals

1. Enable users to analyze DeFi project documents (whitepapers, code)
2. Provide basic risk assessment scoring
3. Generate simple visualizations of risk profiles
4. Allow users to save and manage their analyses
5. Implement essential user authentication

## Success Metrics

The MVP will be considered successful if:

1. Users can successfully upload and analyze DeFi project documents
2. The system can identify at least 70% of common risk factors
3. Users can save and retrieve their analyses
4. The platform maintains 99% uptime
5. Initial user feedback indicates the tool provides valuable insights

## Post-MVP Priorities

After launching the MVP, the following features will be prioritized:

1. Advanced AI analysis capabilities
2. Comparative analysis between projects
3. Real-time market data integration
4. Expanded visualization options
5. Collaboration features
